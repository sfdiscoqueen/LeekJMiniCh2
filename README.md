// Mini-Challenge #2 "Add 2 Numbers"
// This is an application that asks the user to input two numbers, then adds them together and prints the sum

// peer review: Madeline Gowan
//It runs as intended. However I think more data validation could be helpful, such as adding .ToLower(); to Console.ReadLine() so that
//it will recognize "end" even if you type it with a capital(s). Other than that I believe it's good!
